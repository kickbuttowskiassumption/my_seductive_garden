<p><b>Interior design or home décor is all about altering the inside of the concrete structures we live in and call them home. If you sit back and think, it is astonishing at how much of the outside we want to bring inside through large windows, wood and stone finishes, and posters of far off places and floral accents that are little reminders of the beauty of the outside that we crave. Of all of our endeavours to include nature in our living environment the most rewarding is bringing green plants within our homes.<br>

One should never underestimate the impact a live plant has on a space, there is an instant transformation. It immediately becomes more welcoming, bright, lively and there is a certain generosity that seeps in, the room puts you at ease. This ease has become more accessible with the availability of online plants.</b></p>

<h1><b> Where to Keep Plants in Home </b></h1>
<p> <b> Plants can be included in our homes in many ways and there is a green plant suited for every home and every corner. There is no room or corners that a plant cannot uplift and all they need in return is a little bit of light, water, and love. So before you go online plant shopping, be clear on the area or room for which you want to buy plants online.<br><p></p>

Let’s start at the doorways, one of the most neglected spaces in the urban setup. Most of us either rent or buy flats and have no say in lobby design or how the main door looks, but you can always make your entryway standout by buying live plants online by the door. Add online plants that grow erect and show variegations to save space as well as create interest in your home. While buying live plants online makes everything easy, the question is why should you buy plants online or otherwise, basically why should you buy green plants?
Traditionally, green plants have always been bought from a local nursery and online plant shopping is something new and still unexplored, but we are here to convince you that online plant shopping might be the best thing yet after instant noodles.
Live plants online are now available with many sellers, and they are just that sellers and they do not guarantee the quality of the plants for sale online Like we at Omkar's Garden do. We are not sellers, we grow our own plant.

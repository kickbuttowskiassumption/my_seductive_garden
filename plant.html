<h1 ><b>Plant</b></h1>

<p><b>Plants are a great addition to our homes and life for both their physical and psychological benefits. 
Plants are immobile living organisms rooted in the ground or water with around 3,00,000 species inhabiting the earth. But other than this fact, what do you know about plants? Broadly classifying, plants are divided into two categories- flowering and non-flowering plants. Some flowering varieties are roses, orchids and most trees while non-flowering plants are the varieties of mosses and ferns. Digging some more information of plants, we got to know that plants take energy from the sun to make their food. While the quantity varies, they do need water for survival.</b></p>
<h1><b>*How do plants grow?</b></h1>
<p><b>Plants mostly grow from seeds, that may remain inactive for days, months or even years. The seed consists of some food and a protective layer surrounding an embryo from which a seedling develops. Dark and moist conditions in the right temperature help the seed to germinate. First, the roots begin to grow downwards and make the plant stable. The shoots begin to grow upwards towards the sunlight. Finally, the plant produces a stem and leaf. Isn’t it all fascinating?<br> <img src="D:\omkar garden project\images\grow.jpg",height="300" width="300"> <br>Plants don’t move around, that we all know, yet they manage to get all that they want, grow big, really big! I wonder what makes them grow? Yes, the basic answer comes to my mind; sunlight, soil, and water, but closer introspection of this answer tells me what they need to grow, not how they grow. So this article is an attempt to answer all these questions.Plants are living organisms, comprising a vast variety of species such as trees, shrubs and bushes, herbs, grasses, vines, ferns, moss, and green algae. They belong to the kingdom Plantae. With over 350,000 (identified) species and still counting, plants are the largest group of organisms found on this planet. Plants consist of six basic parts; roots, stem (branches), flowers, fruits, seeds and leaves.<br> <img src="D:\omkar garden project\images\grow2.jpg",height="300" width="300"><br> Each part plays a role in the plant’s growth. Plants extract their food from the atmosphere using the process of photosynthesis with the help of chlorophyll, a green-colored pigment. With this process plants use the sunlight’s energy to convert atmospheric carbon dioxide into simple sugars, which is then used to build the plants structural component. Plants also rely on soil for nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, magnesium, etc) and water. This explains the basic needs that makes plants grow. But then there are plants that grow without soil, or in the dark without sunlight. Plants use the method of photosynthesis and respiration to produce food, and on this premise will grow anywhere they get it.<br> Plants grow from seeds, because the seeds contain within themselves an embryonic plant and stored food. The seed is a result of pollination, where the ripened ovule is protected by the seed coat, an outer covering of the ovule. Basically, the seed contains the whole immature plant (roots and leaves), the seed’s leaves are called the cotyledons; a seed with one leaf is known as monocotyledonous or monocots, while a two-leaved seed is known as dicotyledonous or dicots. For a seed to germinate, right conditions such as quality of the endosperm (food within the seed), moisture, temperature, humidity, light, and quality of the nutrients in the soil, all come in play.<br> <img src="D:\omkar garden project\images\grow3.jpg",height="300" width="300"><br> When seeds are sown, ‘keep it in a dark place’ is generally a common instruction, but by dark one never means absolute dark, it just refers to keeping the seeds away from direct sunlight. Plants need a source of light to grow, to produce their food through the process of photosynthesis. If plants do not receive light, they will not be able to produce chlorophyll, eventually losing their green color and they will die. This rule also applies to plants that have different colored leaves too. Some plants may grow in the dark, but they are equipped to source their light from the atmosphere. Try a simple experiment at home, take a small plant and keep it in dark, one may have to cover it, and see for yourself, in a few days your plant will wither and die.<br></b></p>
<h1><b>*Flowering Plants</b></h1>
<img src="D:\omkar garden project\images\flower.jpg",height="300" width="300">
<p><b>Flowering plants, also known as angiosperms, grow flowers and use seeds to reproduce using the process of pollination. Both male and female plants are present in flower. These are almost 90% of the known species. Contrary to popular belief, grasses are also a type of flowering plant.Flowering plants, or angiosperms are the largest grouping within the plant kingdom (Kingdom Plantae or Viridiplantae) in terms of the numbers of described species. Approximately 260,000 species of flowering plant have been named so far, constituting nearly 90% of all known species of plants. Even so, taxonomists describe many new species annually, and estimates of total angiosperm diversity reach as high as 400,000 species. There are about 450 families of flowering plants, displaying extremely diverse life histories and ecological adaptations. In addition to dominating plant biodiversity, angiosperms are the dominant photosynthetic organisms (primary producers) in most terrestrial ecosystems (an important exception to this rule are the boreal forests, which are often dominated by conifers). All important food plants are angiosperms.

<h1><b>*Non Flowering Plants</b></h1>
<img src= "D:\omkar garden project\images\nonflower.jpg",height="300" width="300">
<p><b>Non-flowering plants do not grow flowers and reproduce using seeds or spores by dispersion. Gymnosperms are the kind of plants that do not produce a flower but produce seeds, while mosses and ferns reproduce using seeds.Hope this has imparted much knowledge about plants and their working mechanisms. We will be back with some more fascinating information on plants in some other blogs soon. Until then, make your interiors come alive with lush indoor plants and breathe fresh all the time.Gymnosperms are any type of vascular plant that reproduce via an exposed seed. While most flowering plants, known as angiosperms, have a seed enclosed in an ovary or fruit, gymnosperms (which means "naked seeds") do not have covers on their seeds.<br>
	<p>                                                   </p>
  <b>>>>></b>Non-flowering plants, also known as gymnosperms and ferns, do not produce flowers. Here are some examples of non-flowering plants:
<ul>
<li>Conifers: These are gymnosperms, which means they produce seeds but not flowers. Conifers include trees like pines, spruces, and firs.</li>
<li>Cycads: These are also gymnosperms and have large, fern-like leaves. They are often used as ornamental plants.</li>
<li>Ginkgo: This is a gymnosperm with distinctive fan-shaped leaves. It is often planted as an ornamental tree.</li>
<li>Ferns: These are plants with feathery leaves that reproduce through spores instead of seeds. Ferns are often used as houseplants or as a decorative element in gardens.</li>
<li>Mosses: These are small, non-vascular plants that grow in damp environments. They do not have true roots, stems, or leaves and reproduce through spores.</li>
<li>Liverworts: These are small, leafy plants that grow in moist environments. They do not have true roots or stems and reproduce through spores.</li>
<li>Lichens: These are symbiotic organisms that consist of a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, such as algae or cyanobacteria. Lichens grow on rocks, trees, and other surfaces, and are often used as indicators of air pollution.</li>

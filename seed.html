<p><b>Growing your own vegetables and herbs at home has never been easier and with our extensive range of organic seeds, you can buy any seeds online with the guarantee of quality.<br>Most of us start our gardening journey with plants and when we feel we know enough (which is never enough) we move towards gardening with seeds. The first step of gardening with seeds is enough to test any gardener’s patience and that step is germination.
When you buy seeds online it is important to make sure that they are organic seeds and of a good quality<br></b></p>
<h1><b>*Why are organic seeds better?</b></h1>
<p><b>Organic seeds are better than genetically modified seeds because they have the original genetic makeup of the plant that are healthier for consumption and have a higher nutrient percentage. Organic seeds also help protect the ecosystem. When you buy organic seeds online you are guaranteeing your health and your family’s health. Growing food at home organic seeds online from a trusted online seeds store gives you a truly farm to table experience that reduces not only the strain on the global food chain but also reduces the carbon footprint of the food we consume.

 <h1><b>*How to germinate seeds?</b></h1>
 <p><b>Whether you buy your organic seeds online or from a store, germination is an exact science. When you buy seeds online make sure that the seeds are within the time range for successful germination<br>
 Sometimes we do everything right and by the book and it still doesn’t work out and the seeds don’t germinate and we have been getting a lot of queries about seed germination rates falling in the winters.<br><p></p>
 Let’s take a look at the process or steps of seed germination.
 <p></p>
 <p>▶ Select the seeds as per season. Summer seeds need a higher temperature to sprout, as compared to winter seeds.<br>
▶ Fill small seedling pots, paper cups, plastic cups or any such small planter with a well-draining potting mix. Make sure the planter has good drainage holes.<br>
▶ Moisten the soil and let all the water drain out from the drainage hole at the bottom.<br>
▶ Sow the seeds at a depth of not more than twice or thrice the diameter of the seed itself. Don’t press the seed in too deep.<br>
▶ It is always better to start your seeds indoors where it is easier to control light and temperature of the soil. Seeds germinate the best between 20 to 30 degree Celsius. It is also important to remember that the moist soil temperature is always a few degrees lower than the ambient temperature.<br>
▶ For the first two days you can cover the seedling tray or your germination setup with a jute rag or a corrugated cardboard to trap the moisture and heat and also provide darkness. Seeds germinate quicker in the dark.<br>
▶ After two days, when you can see tiny sprouts come up, remove the cover on top if you have used one and place the setup in a well-lit area indoors.<br>
▶ Keep the soil moist, but not soggy, by watering it regularly with either a spray or bottom watering. Watering carefully with teaspoons also works fine, take care to not move the soil or drown the seedling.<br>
▶ Once the first two sets of cotyledon leaves (round leaves) come up. Place the seedling setup in a much brightly lit area like windowsill or shaded balconies where it doesn’t get direct harsh sun.<br>
▶ Once the first 2 pairs of true leaves appear and the sapling is now more than a couple of inches tall, you can transplant it to your final planter with a good potting mix.</p><br>
<p>Pro tips for successful seeds germination</p>
<p>✅ Store your seeds in an airtight container in a cool, dry, and dark place.<br>
✅ To further improve the chances of germinating and reduce the time span of the cycle, soak your seeds in water overnight before planting.<br>
✅ Germinate your seeds in a moist potting mix. Moist but not soggy.<br>
✅ Don’t let the soil stay dry for two long, keep wetting the topsoil in a controlled manner.</p>
